- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints (Python 3.11+)
- Include docstrings
- Add error handling
- Write tests

### 📊 Data Sources

**Adding New Threat Intel Sources**
- Ensure source is free and reliable
- Add to appendices/A-threat-intel-sources.md
- Provide example integration code
- Document API rate limits and authentication

### 🌍 Translations

Interested in translating to other languages?
- Open an issue to coordinate
- Create `chapters-[lang]/` directory
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Keep technical terms accurate

## Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/raghavpoonia/living-threat-intel.git
cd living-threat-intel

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest implementation/tests/

# Run collectors locally
python implementation/collectors/cisa_collector.py
```

## Code Review Process

1. **Submit PR** with clear description
2. **CI/CD runs**: Tests, linting, type checking
3. **Maintainer review**: Usually within 48 hours
4. **Iterate** based on feedback
5. **Merge** once approved

## Coding Standards

**Python**
- Python 3.11+
- Type hints for all functions
- Docstrings (Google style)
- Error handling with specific exceptions
- Logging instead of print statements

**Example:**
```python
from typing import Optional
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def fetch_cisa_kev(date: Optional[str] = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Fetch CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities.
    
    Args:
        date: Optional ISO format date (YYYY-MM-DD)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing vulnerability data
        
    Raises:
        requests.HTTPError: If API request fails
        ValueError: If date format is invalid
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        pass
    except requests.HTTPError as e:
        logger.error(f"CISA API error: {e}")
        raise
```

## Documentation Standards

**Chapters**
- Use CommonMark Markdown
- Include practical exercises
- Provide complete, runnable code examples
- Reference real CVEs and threat actors from 2024-2025
- Add "Further Reading" sections

**Code Comments**
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Link to relevant chapters or external resources
